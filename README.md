# school-opengl-project
My personal fork of a group project from a computer graphics class. The original can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Deckarius/CS4450-Final-Project).
This was made to be a simple minecraft-like game. The game is written in Java and uses the [lwjgl](https://www.lwjgl.org/) library.
The entire world is generated with Perlin noise and changes each time the game is reloaded.


The original class project featured two other members and was broken up into three check points.
